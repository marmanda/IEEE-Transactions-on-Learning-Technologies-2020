	abstract = {This paper reviews the principal approaches to using Artificial Intelligence in Music Education. Music is a challenging domain for Artificial Intelligence in Education (AI-ED) because music is, in general, an open-ended domain demanding creativity and problem-seeking on the part of learners and teachers. In addition, Artificial Intelligence theories of music are far from complete, and music education typically emphasises factors other than the communication of ‘knowledge’ to students. This paper reviews critically some of the principal problems and possibilities in a variety of AI-ED approaches to music education. Approaches considered include: Intelligent Tutoring Systems for Music; Music Logo Systems; Cognitive Support Frameworks that employ models of creativity; highly interactive interfaces that employ AI theories; AI-based music tools; and systems to support negotiation and reflection. A wide variety of existing music AI-ED systems are used to illustrate the key issues, techniques and methods associated with these approaches to AI-ED in Music.},

	abstract = {Our work bridges two interesting topics: the research in the area of web-based applications and the area of learning technologies. We give an overall picture of the current development in webbased music intelligent tutoring system (WMITS). The term WMITS is coined by us to describe the two main areas in our focus. In this chapter, we address the following issues: (i) the pedagogical aspect of teaching and learning music, (ii) the background of music intelligent tutoring system and (iii) our WMITS system for teaching music theories. A web-based environment offers strengths in terms of accessibility and self-paced learning. However, the environment has a great drawback in terms of inter-activities between the users and the system. Our design addresses this issue by developing a specialised client tool. The client tool provides an interactive environment for score editing which is crucial for learning music theories. The system incorporates three major inference techniques (i.e. Deductive, Inductive, and Bayesian Inference) in dealing with music theories and uncertain knowledge such as students' understanding.},

This work presents a unique perspective on gesture-based interactions, categorized in terms of four key elements: gesture styles, the application domains they are applied to, input technologies and output technologies used for implementation. The taxonomy provides a means of addressing gestures as an interaction mode across the different application domains so that researchers and designers can draw on the vast amount of research that has been addressed within the literature from an interaction perspective.}
